# Phase 4: Core Development - MVP Build  
**Objective:** Develop the foundational system including core context engine, MCP protocol server, embedding search, and basic orchestration enabling a working end-to-end solution.

***

## TODO List

### 1. Local File Monitoring & Incremental Indexing
- [x] Implement file system watcher supporting native APIs on target OSes (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- [x] Integrate Tree-sitter for multi-language parsing of project code files
- [x] Design incremental parsing and AST update on file change/save
- [x] Extract semantic code chunks based on AST (functions, classes, etc.)
- [x] Implement efficient storage/cache of parsed data for quick retrieval

### 2. Embedding & Semantic Search  
- [x] Integrate local embedding generation model (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2 or equivalent)  
- [x] Develop vectorization pipeline for code chunks  
- [x] Choose and set up vector database (ChromaDB or Faiss) for persistence and similarity search  
- [x] Implement vector index update on code change events (incremental vector updates)  
- [x] Implement semantic search API supporting query embedding and nearest neighbors retrieval  

### 3. MCP Server Development  
- [ ] Implement MCP transport layers: stdio and HTTP JSON-RPC server  
- [ ] Define MCP server config management (YAML files, environment variables)  
- [ ] Create Tool Registry to dynamically register MCP tools exposed to clients  
- [ ] Develop core MCP tools following MCP API:  
    - `code_search` (semantic search query)  
    - `context_analysis` (complexity, dependencies)  
    - `semantic_completion` (code snippet completion)  
- [ ] Build request routing and handling compliance with MCP spec  

### 4. PocketFlow Integration  
- [ ] Integrate PocketFlow orchestration framework for multi-agent workflows  
- [ ] Define task delegation mechanism to agents for code analysis, search, and completions  
- [ ] Implement basic PocketFlow sample workflows (e.g., code search workflow)  
- [ ] Ensure robust error handling and retry in task executions  
- [ ] Set max agents and workflow timeout according to config  

### 5. CLI Interface and Developer Tools  
- [ ] Build MVP CLI tool for administrative tasks and debug commands  
- [ ] Implement CLI commands for search, analyze, completion, and config management  
- [ ] Enable CLI to connect as an MCP client or directly invoke server tools  

### 6. Testing & CI  
- [ ] Set up unit testing framework for individual components (file watcher, parser, MCP server)  
- [ ] Develop integration tests covering end-to-end flow (file change → indexing → search → MCP tool call)  
- [ ] Integrate continuous integration (CI) pipeline for builds and automated tests  
- [ ] Perform code quality and security scans on the codebase  

### 7. Documentation  
- [ ] Write technical documentation for MCP server setup and tool API  
- [ ] Document configuration options and usage examples  
- [ ] Add developer guide explaining PocketFlow integration and workflow design  
- [ ] Provide quick start for local development and testing environments  

***

## Milestones

- [ ] **End-to-end semantic code search:**  
  MCP client sends `code_search` request → MCP server routes request → PocketFlow coordinates → Context engine searches vector DB → results returned to client.  
- [ ] **Stable MCP server with stdio and HTTP transports supporting core tools**  
- [ ] **Working PocketFlow orchestration for key workflows**  
- [ ] **Basic CLI tool with core commands for dev diagnostics**  
- [ ] **Validated incremental file indexing with Tree-sitter**  
- [ ] **Complete unit and integration test coverage with CI pipeline**  
- [ ] **Comprehensive MVP documentation for developers**

This comprehensive phase sets the foundation to build a powerful, extensible, and local-privacy-preserving developer context engine fully compliant with MCP protocols and capable of working with any MCP-compatible client seamlessly.
