# MCP-Based Local Development Context Engine  
## Phases 1 to 3: Discovery, Requirements & Design  

---

## 1. Product Vision & Target Users

### Vision Statement  
Create a **privacy-first, model-agnostic, MCP-powered local context engine** that connects transparently with any MCP-compatible IDE client or tool (such as Roocode, Cline, Cursor, Claude Desktop). This system delivers expressive code understanding, fast semantic search, and context-aware developer tooling, while strictly maintaining all data and processing locally. User interaction is through their chosen MCP client; no direct chatting with the server is required.

### Target Users  
- Developers using diverse MCP-enabled IDEs and clients  
- Teams and enterprises with strict data residency and compliance requirements  
- Open-source maintainers and contributors needing local AI tools  
- Multi-language, multi-client development environments

## 2. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Functional Requirements  
- Local file system monitoring with incremental indexing using Tree-sitter  
- Embedding generation and high-performance semantic search using ChromaDB or Faiss  
- MCP server supporting both stdio and HTTP transports  
- Exposed MCP tools:  
  - `code_search(query: string, language?: string, top_k?: number)`  
  - `context_analysis(file_path: string, analysis_type: "complexity" | "dependencies")`  
  - `semantic_completion(code_snippet: string)`  
  - `test_suggestion(function_name: string, file_path: string)`  
- Integration of PocketFlow for multi-agent workflow orchestration  
- Configuration support through YAML files and environment variables  
- CLI interface for administrative tasks and diagnostics (optional)  
- Plugin system for flexible tool extensions and event hooks  
- Web-based dashboard for visual monitoring and operational overview (no user interaction)  

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- Query latency under 50ms for projects with 10,000+ files  
- 100% local data processing to guarantee privacy and offline usability  
- Robust error handling and automatic recovery for workflow orchestration and tool calls  
- Extensible architecture enabling community and custom integrations  

### MVP Scope  
- Real-time local indexing and semantic search functionality  
- Fully working MCP server exposing core tools and workflows  
- Verification of seamless integration with at least one MCP client (e.g., Cursor, Claude Desktop)  
- Operational web dashboard for status visualization (not user-facing)

## 3. Architecture & System Design

### High-Level Architecture Diagram

![42 Context Arc](./images/42ContextArc.png)

- **MCP Clients** connect over stdio or HTTP using MCP protocol; all user interaction happens in these clients.  
- **MCP Server** manages incoming requests, exposes tools, and delegates complex logic to PocketFlow workflows.  
- **PocketFlow** manages multi-agent orchestration and the execution of workflows like code analysis and search.  
- **Context Engine** performs real-time file watching, syntax parsing, semantic embedding, and fast vector search.  
- **Model Adapter** provides flexibility to connect any local or remote embedding or language model.  
- **Web Dashboard** provides operational visualization and health metrics, not used for user interaction.

### Core Components  
- **MCP Transport Layer:** Handles stdio and HTTP transports and JSON-RPC protocol messages  
- **PocketFlow:** Manages the orchestration of agents and workflows for multi-step tasks  
- **Context Engine:** Watches files, generates ASTs via Tree-sitter, creates & manages vector embeddings  
- **Tool Registry:** Dynamically registers and exposes MCP tools to clients  
- **Model Adapter:** Abstracts embeddings and completions to provided models (local or remote)

## 4. MCP API and Plugin Architecture

### MCP Tool APIs (Examples)

```
interface McpTools {
  code_search: {
    query: string;
    language?: string;
    top_k?: number;
  };
  context_analysis: {
    file_path: string;
    analysis_type: "complexity" | "dependencies";
  };
  semantic_completion: {
    code_snippet: string;
  };
  test_suggestion: {
    function_name: string;
    file_path: string;
  };
}
```

### Plugin API

- **Event Hooks**: Listen for file changes (`onCodeChange`) and search invocations (`onSearch`)  
- **Result Filtering and Enhancement**: Plugins can modify or augment search and analysis results  
- **Extension Points**: Add new tools and workflows, register agents with PocketFlow, extend CLI commands

## 6. Early Prototypes Summary

- File system watcher detecting code changes and incremental updates using Tree-sitter  
- Local embedding generation for semantic code chunks  
- Persistent vector storage and fast similarity search (ChromaDB/Faiss)  
- MCP protocol handshake and communication tested with one MCP-compatible client  
- Minimal CLI example for administrative commands and search queries  

---

## 7. UX Wireframe Concepts

- **Web Dashboard**: Visualizes project status, indexing progress, server health, and logs   
- **No VS Code panel or dedicated UI**: User interfaces exist exclusively within MCP-compatible clients

This document is provisioned as a comprehensive foundation for Phases 1-3, ready to jumpstart core development (Phase 4+). It aligns closely with your architecture emphasizing seamless MCP integration and privacy-first local processing.

If you want, I can provide this as a clean downloadable Markdown file or segmented sections for your working environment.
